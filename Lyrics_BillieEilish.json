  "plain": "Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O'Connell (born December 18, 2001), known professionally as Billie Eilish, is an American singer and songwriter born and raised in Los Angeles, California.\n\nWorking alongside her older brother Finneas, her co-writer and producer, she\u2019s taken the internet by storm with her haunting vocals and eerily beautiful lyrics and genre-defying production that was poised to breakout.\n\nFor Billie, creating music wasn\u2019t always her niche\u2014dancing was. Born and raised in the entertainment mecca of Los Angeles, from a family comprised of musicians and actors, Billie was enthralled in the spotlight of dance. However, amid a growth plate injury in 2015, she was in practice for a recital dancing eleven hours a week for, she became an underground pop sensation.\n\nSinging and songwriting had never been unknown to Billie, having written her first song at four and joined the Los Angeles Children\u2019s Choir at eight. So when her dance instructor was looking for a song to choreograph, Billie, with help from Finneas, created \u201cocean eyes.\u201d The two also agreed to upload it to SoundCloud, where it went viral with over two million streams, landing her a record deal with Interscope.\n\nFrom there, several remixes spawned and a follow-up single \u201cSix Feet Under\u201d was released the following year.\n\nIn 2017, she released her debut EP, dont smile at me, which received mainstream applause and landed her a spot on Apple Music\u2019s showcase for upcoming artists, UpNext. The EP also hit the top 40 on the Billboard 200 on July 19th.\n\nOn March 29th, 2019, Billie Eilish released her highly anticipated debut album, WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? \u2014 a record centered around Eilish\u2019s fascination with dreams and nightmares. Two weeks before its release, the album was officially given the title of \u201cmost pre-saved album of all time on Apple Music,\u201d with over 800,000 to its name.\n\nIn 2020, Billie Eilish was nominated for 6 categories for the 62nd Grammy Awards ceremony, alongside with her brother Finneas. She was nominated in the five main categories (\u201cAlbum of the Year\u201d, \u201cBest New Artist\u201d, \u201cBest Pop Solo Performance\u201d, \u201cSong of the Year\u201d, Record of the Year\") and \u201cBest Pop Vocal Album\u201d. Finneas was nominated in \u201cProducer of the Year \u2013 non classical\u201d and he won. Eilish won 5 Grammys in the 62nd ceremony: Album of the Year (\u201cWHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO ?\u201d), Song of the Year (\u201cbad guy\u201d), Record of the Year (\u201cbad guy\u201d), Best New Artist and Best Pop Vocal Album (\u201cWHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO ?).\n\nIn 2021, Billie and Finneas also won in the 63rd Grammy Awards with two categories: Best Song Written for a Visual Media (\u201cNo Time To Die\u201d, for the last James Bond movie) and Record of the Year (\u201ceverything i wanted\u201d, released in 2019).\n\nOn April 26, 2021, Billie Eilish teased the album\u2019s title track, Happier Than Ever. Shortly after, billboards appeared in different locations that revealed the album\u2019s title and release date of July 30, 2021, and an Instagram post from April 27 revealed the album\u2019s cover artwork and announced the release of a new single on April 29, 2021. Eilish broke her previous record for the most pre-saved album with a whopping 1,028,000 pre-saves for Happier Than Ever.\n\nOn March 22, 2022 Billie and Finneas won the Oscar for best original song with No Time to Die. The Oscar was both the first nomination and the first win for the brother/sister team. The win was also record-breaking, with Billie becoming the youngest artist to have three awards on the same song."
